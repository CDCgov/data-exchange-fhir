# Steps
- Step 1: Update appsettings.Local.json file. "RunEnvironment": Needs to be set to "Local"."LocalDevFolder" needs to be set to the location you want the Bundle file to be saved.
- Step 2: OneCDPFHIRFacade.csproj under <DefineConstants>runLocal</DefineConstants> needs to be set to "RunLocal".
- Step 3: Run application by pressing Start Application (F5).
- Step 4: In postman under body, either past a raw Bundle or upload file under form-data. Key needs to be "file" of type File.
