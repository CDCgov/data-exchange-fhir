This parameter overrides any specified version in the library and value sets (and any it depends on). The format is the same as a canonical URL: [system]|[version] - e.g. http://loinc.org|2.56. Note that this has obvious safety issues, in that it may result in a value set expansion giving a different list of codes that is both wrong and unsafe, and implementers should only use this capability reluctantly. It primarily exists to deal with situations where specifications have fallen into decay as time passes. If the value is override, the version used SHALL explicitly be represented in the expansion parameters","type":"canonical"},{"name":"manifest","use":"in","min":0,"max":"1","documentation":"Specifies an asset-collection library that defines version bindings for code systems referenced by the value set(s) being expanded.
