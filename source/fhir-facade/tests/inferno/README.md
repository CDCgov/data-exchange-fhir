To run Inferno tests from the command line, you typically need to use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha, as Inferno is a JavaScript library and works with common JavaScript testing frameworks. If you're referring to Inferno as the frontend JavaScript library, here's how you can run tests for an Inferno application.

Here's a general guide to running Inferno tests from the command line using **Jest**:

### 1. Set up your Inferno project
If you haven't already, make sure you have Inferno and Jest set up in your project.

1. Install Inferno:
   ```bash
   npm install inferno
   ```

2. Install Jest (if it's not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest
   ```

### 2. Create a test file
Create a test file in your `src` folder, e.g., `App.test.js`. Here's an example of a basic test for an Inferno component:

```javascript
import { render } from 'inferno';
import { shallow } from 'inferno-test-utils'; // this is for shallow rendering
import App from './App'; // your component

describe('App component', () => {
  it('should render correctly', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<App />);
    expect(wrapper).toBeDefined(); // Adjust to your test needs
  });
});
```

### 3. Set up Jest in `package.json`
If you don't already have it, you can configure Jest to run your tests by adding a script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```

### 4. Run the tests
Now, you can run the tests from the command line with:

```bash
npm test
```

or if you want to run a specific test file:

```bash
npx jest path/to/test/file
```

### 5. Running Jest in Watch Mode (Optional)
If you want Jest to re-run tests when files change, you can use the watch mode:

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

This will keep Jest running and automatically rerun tests when you modify files.

### 6. Running with Mocha (Alternative)
If you prefer Mocha over Jest, the setup would look like this:

1. Install Mocha and other dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev mocha chai inferno
   ```

2. Create a test file, e.g., `test/App.test.js`:

   ```javascript
   const { render } = require('inferno');
   const { expect } = require('chai');
   const App = require('../src/App'); // your component

   describe('App component', () => {
     it('should render without errors', () => {
       const component = render(<App />);
       expect(component).to.be.ok; // Adjust to your test needs
     });
   });
   ```

3. Run tests with Mocha:
   ```bash
   npx mocha test/**/*.test.js
   ```

This approach uses Mocha and Chai instead of Jest.
